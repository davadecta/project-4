The code provides an example of a simple REST API that retrieves data from a MySQL database using a GET request.

The key steps involved in this example are:

Connect to the database using PDO (PHP Data Objects) extension.

Define the API endpoint for the GET request. In this case, the endpoint is '/api/my_data', which is accessed using an HTTP GET request.

Query the database to retrieve data from the 'my_table' table using a SELECT statement.

Fetch the data using PDO fetchAll() method with PDO::FETCH_ASSOC option to return an associative array.

Set the content type of the response to 'application/json' using the header() function.

Encode the fetched data as JSON using the json_encode() function.

Send the JSON-encoded data as the API response.

This API follows the basic principles of REST architecture, including:

Uniform interface: the API endpoint and HTTP method are clearly defined.
Stateless communication: each request is independent and does not rely on previous requests.
Client-server architecture: the client sends requests to the server, and the server sends responses back.
Cacheability: the response can be cached to reduce server load.
